    "We base our states on the existing theory of how fireflies work. Namely, we recognized the following states: `RECOVERING`, `READY` and `FLASH`. The `RECOVERING` state denotes that the firefly is still recovering and cannot flash at the next time step. The `READY` state means that, at any succeeding time step, the firefly has some chance of flashing. The `FLASH` state denotes the act of flashing.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Ruleset\n",
    "The ruleset for updating each cell are as follows:\n",
    "- If there exists a flashing firefly in the neighborhood and the firefly is ready, flash.\n",
    "- If there is no flashing firefly in the neighborhood and the firefly is ready, flash only when it reaches a certain amount of threshold.\n",
    "- If firefly flashes, set a timer for a certain set amount of time and go to recovery state.\n",
